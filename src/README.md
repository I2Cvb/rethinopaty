#Code
The code is structured as a set of autotested APIs (modules),
containing the core code of the project. Apart form this, the
experiments suporting the paper would be structured using
a jupiter notebook that would support the evidence for the
scientific results.

Some of the modules would have its own repository that would
be loaded as git-submodule, otherwise would belong only to
this project.
